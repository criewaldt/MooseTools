ShiftCheckout : Checkout Calculator

Used to calculate terminal checkout and employee tip information after a shift.

This will be hosted by an on-site raspberry pi. Users will connect to a dedicated network and navigate to the Flask host address. Checkout reports will be saved locally for retrevial via SSH if needed (or maybe served directly through a Flask endpoint?..).
